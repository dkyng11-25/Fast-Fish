# GIT RECOVERY STATUS REPORT

**Date:** 2025-07-30  
**Issue:** Git merge conflict deleted steps 24-33  
**Resolution:** ✅ **FULLY RECOVERED**  
**Status:** All systems operational

---

## 🚨 **ISSUE SUMMARY**

### **What Happened:**
- Git merge conflict between `andy-dev` and remote branches
- Steps 24-33 were accidentally deleted during merge resolution
- System reverted from 33 steps back to 24 steps
- All output files and deliverables were at risk

### **Root Cause:**
- Local changes to `src/step6_cluster_analysis.py` conflicted with remote changes
- Git merge strategy overwrote our new steps (24-33) with older versions
- Branch divergence created confusion about which files to keep
