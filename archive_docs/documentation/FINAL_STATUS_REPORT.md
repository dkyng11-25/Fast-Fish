### Previously Missing Steps Now Documented
- Step 7: Missing Category Rule with Quantity Recommendations
- Step 8: Imbalanced Allocation Rule with Quantity Rebalancing

## Detailed Documentation Coverage

### Total Steps Documented: 34
- Steps 1-33 (primary pipeline steps)
- Step 2b (specialized seasonal data consolidation)
- Steps 7-8 (previously missing rule-based analysis steps)

### Documentation Quality
Each step has been documented with:
- Clear purpose and business value statements
- Comprehensive input/output specifications
- Detailed transformation processes
- Dependency mapping
- Success metrics and validation criteria
- Error handling procedures
- Performance considerations
