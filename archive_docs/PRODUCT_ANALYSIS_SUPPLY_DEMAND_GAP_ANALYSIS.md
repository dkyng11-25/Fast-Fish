## 📈 **CROSS-CLUSTER SUPPLY-DEMAND PATTERNS**

### **Consistent Issues Across All Clusters:**

**1. STANDARD Price Band Crisis:**
```
🚨 CRITICAL PATTERN: All 3 clusters show 30% STANDARD price band shortage
   • Affects 100% of representative clusters
   • Indicates systematic product pool gap in mid-range pricing
   • Business Impact: Missing accessible price points for broad customer base
```

**2. FILLER Product Oversupply:**
```
⚠️ SIGNIFICANT PATTERN: 2/3 clusters have FILLER excess (31.7%, 37.7%)
   • Indicates product pool over-weighted toward gap-filling products
   • Suggests insufficient focus on CORE and SEASONAL products
   • Business Impact: Inventory inefficiency and reduced customer appeal
```

**3. Seasonal Product Deficiency:**
```
⚠️ SIGNIFICANT PATTERN: 2/3 clusters lack adequate SEASONAL products
   • Cluster 0: 18.9% shortage
   • Cluster 4: 20.9% shortage (critical)
   • Business Impact: Reduced ability to capitalize on seasonal trends
```

### **Cluster-Specific Challenges:**

**Fashion-Heavy Cluster (Cluster 2):**
```
🎯 UNIQUE CHALLENGE: Fashion content insufficient (8.9% gap)
   • Product pool doesn't meet fashion-forward expectations
   • May limit trend-setting capability of market leaders
```

**Multi-Role Cluster (Cluster 4):**
```
