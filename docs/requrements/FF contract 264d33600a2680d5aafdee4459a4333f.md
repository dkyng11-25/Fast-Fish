**·  (Proposed):** 重点考量，推荐的数量（如“6个”）并非简单的预测值，而应是AI综合考虑多种因素后给出的优化建议。看似简单的数量背后隐藏着复杂的优化逻辑。这需要AI模型不仅仅进行预测，更要进行约束条件下的优化求解。这些因素应至少包括： Key Consideration: The recommended quantity (e.g., "6 units") is not a simple forecast value but an optimized suggestion given by AI after comprehensively considering multiple factors. Complex optimization logic lies behind the seemingly simple number. This requires the AI model not only to forecast but also to perform optimization under constraints. These factors should include at least:

o 需求预测 (Demand Forecast): Expected sales volume for the product combination in a specific store/cluster during a specific period.

o 门店容量 (Store Capacity): Available shelf space or SPU display limit for the relevant category or display location.

o 售罄率 (Sell-through Rate): Historical and predicted sell-through rate for similar products.

o 盈利性/利润目标 (Profitability/Margin Goals): The optimization goal should include profit maximization, not just sales quantity. Consider metrics like GMROI (Gross Margin Return on Investment).

o 库存约束 (Inventory Constraints): Current inventory levels, available Open-to-Buy budget.

o 商品生命周期阶段 (Product Lifecycle Stage): Allocation for new product introductions, maintenance for core items, gradual reduction for end-of-life products.

o 业务规则 (Business Rules): Any specific strategic constraints (e.g., minimum display quantity requirements).

三. 利用AI进行智能门店聚类

III. Utilize AI for Intelligent Store Clustering

**· A. 聚类数量:** 门店分群数量限制在20 - 40个左右。 **A. Number of Clusters:** Limit the number of store groups to around 20 - 40.

**· B. 基于数据的地理区域（温度带）优化:** 项目的目标之一是利用AI优化现有的基于行政区划的“温度带”分类 。这需要超越行政边界，寻找真正受相似气候条件影响的门店群组。 **B. Data-Driven Geographical Region (Temperature Zone) Optimization:** One project goal is to use AI to optimize the existing "Temperature Zone" classification based on administrative divisions. This requires going beyond administrative boundaries to find store groups truly affected by similar climatic conditions.

**· C. 验证和优化店铺类型标签:** 项目需要验证预设的“店铺类型”标签（基础大众 vs. 时尚型）及其对应的假设客群（如年轻蓝领、重工制造蓝领等）是否准确反映了实际的消费需求 。 **C. Validate and Optimize Store Type Tags:** The project needs to validate whether the predefined "Store Type" tags (Basic Mass vs. Fashion-Oriented) and their corresponding assumed customer segments (e.g., young blue-collar, heavy industry blue-collar) accurately reflect actual consumer demand.

**· D. 将店铺容量（配置数）纳入聚类模型:** 门店的物理容量（能陈列多少SPU）是影响其配货需求的重要因素。大店通常能容纳更宽、更深的商品组合，而小店则需要更精选的商品 。 **D. Incorporate Store Capacity (Configuration Count) into Clustering Model:** A store's physical capacity (how many SPUs it can display) is a significant factor influencing its allocation needs. Larger stores can typically accommodate broader and deeper assortments, while smaller stores require more curated selections.

**· E. 实施动态聚类以适应变化:** 零售环境是动态变化的，门店的销售模式、顾客构成甚至物理条件都可能随时间改变 。因此，一次性的静态聚类结果很快就会过时。 **E. Implement Dynamic Clustering to Adapt to Changes:** The retail environment is dynamic; store sales patterns, customer composition, and even physical conditions can change over time. Therefore, a one-time static clustering result quickly becomes outdated.

**· 完成日期：** 2025年 4 月 30 日。 **Completion Date:** April 30, 2025.

四. 利用AI优化商品组合结构

IV. Utilize AI to Optimize Product Assortment Structure

A. 分析商品池对不同门店集群的适用性与覆盖度

A. Analyze Applicability and Coverage of the Product Pool for Different Store Clusters

在进行具体的货店匹配之前，需要确保整体的“商品池”是结构合理且能够满足不同门店集群需求的 。

Before performing specific store-product matching, ensure the overall "product pool" is structurally sound and capable of meeting the needs of different store clusters.

**· 具体分析内容包括：** **Specific Analysis Content Includes:**

**o 覆盖度分析 (Coverage Analysis)：** 当前的商品池是否包含了各个门店集群根据其特征（如气候、风格、客群）所需要的关键商品属性组合（如季节、性别、品类、风格、价格带等）。AI可以通过对比集群需求画像与商品池属性分布，识别出潜在的商品缺口，即某些集群需要但商品池未能提供的商品类型。 **Coverage Analysis:** Does the current product pool contain the key product attribute combinations (e.g., season, gender, category, style, price band) required by each store cluster based on its characteristics (e.g., climate, style, customer base)? AI can identify potential product gaps (types needed by some clusters but not available in the pool) by comparing cluster demand profiles with the product pool's attribute distribution.

**o 适用性评估 (Applicability Assessment)：** 商品池中的商品结构是否与各集群的需求强度匹配？例如，高销售潜力集群是否能获得足够深度和宽度的商品支持？低潜力集群是否避免了过多滞销风险高的商品？ **Applicability Assessment:** Does the product structure within the pool match the demand intensity of each cluster? For example, do high sales potential clusters receive sufficient product depth and breadth? Do low potential clusters avoid excessive allocation of high slow-moving risk products?

B. AI驱动的商品组合规划技术

B. AI-Driven Product Assortment Planning Techniques

AI驱动的商品组合优化是指利用算法来推荐在不同门店集群或渠道中应该包含哪些商品的理想组合，同时考虑各种业务目标和限制因素 。这超越了简单的历史销售分析，融入了预测和优化能力。

AI-driven assortment optimization refers to using algorithms to recommend the ideal mix of products that should be included in different store clusters or channels, considering various business objectives and constraints. This goes beyond simple historical sales analysis by incorporating forecasting and optimization capabilities.

**· AI进行商品组合优化时通常考虑以下因素：** **Factors Typically Considered by AI in Assortment Optimization:**

**o 需求对齐 (Demand Alignment):** Ensure the assortment matches the forecasted demand of each cluster.

**o 盈利能力 (Profitability):** Aim to maximize category profit, considering individual item margins and inter-product effects (e.g., substitution or incremental value from bundle sales, i.e., "transferable demand").

**o 库存效率 (Inventory Efficiency):** Optimize inventory turnover and reduce excess stock and holding costs while providing sufficient choice. Needs to match product flow rate.

**o 商品角色平衡 (Product Roles Balance):** Ensure the assortment includes appropriate proportions of basic/core items, fashion/trend items, and products at different price points to meet diverse customer needs and shopping scenarios.

**o 空间限制 (Space Constraints):** Consider store shelf capacity requirements.

**o 本地化 (Localization):** Customize assortments based on local preferences identified through store cluster analysis.

C. 确保商品结构动态支持门店集群需求

C. Ensure Dynamic Assortment Structure to Support Store Cluster Needs

商品组合规划并非一成不变，它必须与门店聚类的结果紧密联动，并能动态调整以适应变化。

Assortment planning is not static; it must be closely linked with store clustering results and be dynamically adjustable to adapt to changes.

**· 联动性 (Linkage)：** 商品组合计划必须足够灵活，能够为Section III中识别出的每一个独特的门店集群提供相关的、有吸引力的商品 。这意味着商品池需要有足够的宽度和深度来满足不同集群的差异化需求。 **Linkage:** The assortment plan must be flexible enough to provide relevant and attractive products for each unique store cluster identified in Section III. This means the product pool needs sufficient breadth and depth to meet the differentiated needs of various clusters.

**· 动态调整 (Dynamic Adjustment)：** 利用AI进行 情景规划 (Scenario Planning) 或“What-if”分析，模拟不同商品组合策略对各个门店集群销售、利润和库存表现的影响 。这有助于在季前规划和季中调整时做出更优决策。 **Dynamic Adjustment:** Use AI for Scenario Planning or "What-if" analysis to simulate the impact of different assortment strategies on sales, profit, and inventory performance for various store clusters. This helps make better decisions during pre-season planning and in-season adjustments.

**· 完成日期：** 2025年 5 月 31 **Completion Date:** May 31, 2025

五. AI驱动的货店匹配与配货

V. AI-Driven Store-Product Matching and Allocation

A. 应用推荐算法进行配货

A. Apply Recommendation Algorithms for Allocation

精准配货的核心环节——决定在特定时间给特定门店（或集群）分配哪些商品以及分配多少——可以被视为一个复杂的 推荐问题 (Recommendation Problem) 。AI的目标是基于所有可用信息，为每个门店/集群推荐最有可能产生良好销售和利润的商品组合及数量。

The core part of precise allocation—deciding which products to allocate to specific stores (or clusters) at specific times and in what quantities—can be viewed as a complex Recommendation Problem. The AI's goal is to recommend the product mix and quantities most likely to generate good sales and profit for each store/cluster, based on all available information.

B. 融合时间维度：季节性、趋势与商品生命周期

B. Integrate Time Dimension: Seasonality, Trend, and Product Lifecycle

配货决策必须具有时间敏感性，充分考虑“合适的时间” 。AI系统需要整合多个时间层面的信息：

Allocation decisions must be time-sensitive, fully considering the "right time". The AI system needs to integrate information from multiple time levels:

**· 时间序列分析 (Time Series Analysis):** Utilize historical sales and inventory data to build models that understand and predict:

**o 季节性 (Seasonality):** Identify recurring sales peaks and troughs at fixed times of the year (e.g., differences between Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter sales).

**o 趋势性 (Trend):** Capture long-term growth or decline trends in sales.

**o 周期性 (Cycle):** Consider fluctuations influenced by macroeconomic or other non-fixed cyclical factors.

**· 商品生命周期 (Product Lifecycle):** Allocation strategies should be adjusted based on the product's lifecycle stage.

**· 短期因素 (Short-Term Factors):** Besides long-term patterns, consider factors affecting short-term demand, such as specific ten-day periods (possibly related to paydays?), planned promotions, holidays, and even short-term weather forecasts (e.g., a sudden cold snap might boost demand for warm clothing).

C. 利用AI需求预测优化配货时机

C. Optimize Allocation Timing Using AI Demand Forecasting

精准的 需求预测 是实现适时配货的关键输入 。AI驱动的需求预测模型能够达到比传统方法更高的准确度。

Accurate Demand Forecasting is the key input for achieving timely allocation. AI-driven demand forecasting models can achieve higher accuracy than traditional methods.

**· 完成日期：** 2025年 7 月 31 **Completion Date:** July 31, 2025

六. 验证AI模型性能与AB测试

VI. Validate AI Model Performance and A/B Testing

A. 持续结果验证与迭代框架

A. Continuous Result Validation and Iteration Framework

AI模型的验证不是项目结束时的一次性验收，而是一个贯穿模型开发、部署和运行全过程的持续性活动 。需要建立一个闭环的反馈与优化机制：

AI model validation is not a one-off acceptance test at the end of the project, but a continuous activity throughout the model development, deployment, and operation process. A closed-loop feedback and optimization mechanism needs to be established:

**· 绩效衡量 (Performance Measurement):** Continuously track and quantify the performance of the AI system (including store clustering, assortment analysis, allocation recommendation components) based on predefined validation metrics (Part I-A, Part VII-B, C, D).

**· 结果分析 (Result Analysis):** Compare model output with actual business results, analyze the reasons for deviations (data issues, model issues, or changes in the external environment?).

**· 识别差距与机会 (Identify Gaps & Opportunities):** Find areas where the model performs poorly or opportunities where model optimization can further enhance business value.

**· 模型调优/再训练 (Model Tuning/Retraining):** Adjust model parameters, change algorithms, or retrain the model using updated data based on analysis results.

**· 部署更新 (Deploy Updates):** Deploy the optimized model version to the production environment.

**· 业务用户参与至关重要。** 除了关注量化指标，还需要业务专家（如商品企划、门店企划、门店运营人员）对模型输出的合理性、可解释性和业务逻辑符合度进行评估，确保模型不仅在统计上最优，在实际业务中也真正可用。 **Business user involvement is crucial.** In addition to quantitative metrics, business experts (e.g., merchandise planners, store planners, store operations staff) need to assess the reasonableness, interpretability, and business logic compliance of the model output to ensure the model is not only statistically optimal but also genuinely usable in actual business operations.

B. 验证门店聚类合理性

B. Validate Store Clustering Reasonableness

评估AI生成的门店聚类结果是否“合理”，需要结合定量指标和定性评估 。

Assessing whether AI-generated store clustering results are "reasonable" requires combining quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluation.

**· 定量指标 (Quantitative Metrics):**

**o 轮廓系数 (Silhouette Score):** Measures the tightness of data points within a cluster (cohesion) and the separation between clusters. Range [-1, 1], higher score indicates better clustering. Score > 0.5 often considered good.

**o 戴维斯-布尔丁指数 (Davies-Bouldin Index):** Measures the ratio of within-cluster scatter to between-cluster separation. Lower index indicates tighter clusters and better separation, hence better clustering.

**o Calinski-Harabasz指数 (Variance Ratio Criterion):** Measures the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. Higher index indicates better clustering.

**· 定性评估 (Qualitative Assessment):**

**o 可解释性 (Interpretability):** Can business users understand why these stores are grouped together? What are the main characteristics of each cluster? Does the clustering clearly reflect intended dimensions like "temperature+shelf count+preference"?

**o 业务逻辑一致性 (Business Logic Alignment):** Do the results align with known market characteristics or business experience? Also, be open to counter-intuitive results revealed by data.

**o 销售表现一致性 (Sales Consistency):** Do stores within the same cluster show high consistency in sales trends, sell-through rates, etc., when selling the same or similar products? Compare key retail metrics (e.g., sales per sq ft, conversion rate, category sales mix) within and between clusters.

**· 关键表 3：门店聚类验证指标与目标 (结构)** **Key Table 3: Store Clustering Validation Metrics and Targets (Structure)** *(Original table [source 15] lists metric names)*

o Metric Name | Target/Description

o Silhouette Score | Target Value (e.g., > 0.5)

o Davies-Bouldin Index | Target Value (e.g., < X)

o Calinski-Harabasz Index | Target Value (e.g., > Y)

o Interpretability Assessment | Qualitative (Understandable by Business)

o Sales Consistency Check | Qualitative/Quantitative (Consistent behavior within cluster)

C. 验证商品结构合理性

C. Validate Product Assortment Structure Reasonableness

评估商品池结构是否“科学”，能否有效支撑各门店集群的需求 。

Assess whether the product pool structure is "scientific" and can effectively support the needs of various store clusters.

**· 验证指标 (Validation Metrics):**

**o 集群需求覆盖度 (Cluster Needs Coverage):** Percentage of key product attribute combinations needed by each cluster that are present in the product pool. Goal: Ensure major needs are covered.

**o 商品流转率匹配度 (Flow Rate Match / Inventory Turnover):** Does the planned assortment support achieving target inventory turnover rates for each cluster? Compare planned vs. actual turnover.

**o 商品角色比例合理性 (Product Role Balance):** Is the proportion of basic/fashion items, different price points, etc., in the assortment appropriate for each cluster's positioning and needs?

**o 毛利回报率 (GMROI):** Can the planned assortment achieve expected profitability targets?

**o 商品冗余/重叠度分析 (Redundancy/Overlap Analysis):** Assess if there are highly similar products (function, style, price) in the assortment, identifying potential simplification opportunities.

**· 关键表 4：商品结构验证指标与目标 (结构)** **Key Table 4: Assortment Structure Validation Metrics and Targets (Structure)** *(Original table [source 17] lists metric names)*

o Metric Name | Target/Description

o Cluster Needs Coverage | Target % (e.g., > 90%)

o Inventory Turnover | Match Target Rate

o Product Role Balance | Align with Cluster Strategy

o GMROI | Meet Target Value

o Product Overlap | Identify & Reduce Redundancy

D. 验证货店匹配合理性（配货效果）

D. Validate Store-Product Matching Reasonableness (Allocation Effectiveness)

This validates the effectiveness of the AI system's core output—allocation recommendations—assessing if it truly achieves allocating the right product in the right quantity to the right store at the right time.

**· 验证指标 (Validation Metrics):**

**o 推荐质量：精确率/召回率 (Recommendation Quality: Precision/Recall):**

**§ 精确率 (Precision):** Among AI-recommended allocated products, what percentage actually sold well (e.g., met a sell-through threshold)?

**§ 召回率 (Recall):** Among all well-selling products, what percentage were recommended for allocation by AI? (Assess relevance and coverage).

**o 销售提升 (Sales Lift):** Measure the improvement in sales for target stores due to AI allocation, via A/B testing (if feasible, with control group) or comparison to historical baseline.

**o 库存表现 (Inventory Performance):** Track inventory-related KPIs for AI-allocated products:

**§ 缺货率 (Stockout Rate):** Frequency or extent of stockouts.

**§ 库存周转率 (Inventory Turnover):** Speed of inventory movement.

**§ 售罄率 (Sell-through Rate):** Speed of product sales. Compare pre/post-AI implementation.

**o 商品生命周期匹配度 (Product Lifecycle Alignment):** Does allocation timing and quantity align with the product's lifecycle stage (introduction, growth, maturity, decline)? Avoid large allocations late in life.

**o 业务反馈 (Business Feedback):** Collect qualitative feedback from frontline staff (planners, operations) on the practicality and usability of AI allocation suggestions.

· 关键表 5：货店匹配（配货效果）验证指标与目标 (结构)

Key Table 5: Store-Product Matching (Allocation Effect) Validation Metrics and Targets (Structure)

(Original table [source 19] lists metric names)

o Metric Name | Target/Description

o Demand Forecast Accuracy (e.g., WAPE - Weighted Absolute Percentage Error) | Target Value (e.g., < X%)

o Forecast Bias | Target Value (e.g., close to 0)

o Recommendation Precision | Target Value (e.g., > Y%)

o Recommendation Recall | Target Value (e.g., > Z%)

o Stockout Rate | Target Value (e.g., < A%)

o Sell-through Rate | Target Value (e.g., > B%)

o Lifecycle Alignment Assessment | Qualitative/Rule-based check

**· 验证的多维性 (Multi-dimensional Validation):** Recognize that AI model validation requires a multi-dimensional approach, looking at quantitative metrics (like Silhouette Score, forecast accuracy) and qualitative business judgment (like cluster interpretability, allocation reasonableness). Over-reliance on a single metric might lead to statistically optimal but practically unusable models.

E. 实施持续监控、漂移检测与模型再训练协议

E. Implement Continuous Monitoring, Drift Detection, and Model Retraining Protocol

AI models are not "set and forget"; performance degrades over time. Establish continuous monitoring and maintenance.

**· 性能跟踪 (Performance Tracking):** Use tools like Model Evaluation Stores to continuously record and track key validation metrics over time.

**· 漂移检测 (Drift Detection):** Monitor two types of drift affecting performance:

**o 数据漂移 (Data Drift):** Significant changes in input data statistical properties (e.g., average store sales, price distribution, customer demographics).

**o 概念漂移 (Concept Drift):** Changes in the underlying relationship between features and the target variable (e.g., changing fashion trends make previously popular styles unpopular).

**· 性能衰退监控 (Performance Degradation Monitoring):** Set performance thresholds; trigger alerts when key metrics (e.g., accuracy, Silhouette Score) drop unacceptably.

**· 自动化警报 (Automated Alerts):** Set up automated alerts for significant drift or performance degradation.

**· 再训练与重建策略 (Retraining & Rebuilding Strategy):**

**o 再训练 (Retraining):** Define conditions (e.g., time period, performance drop) and process for retraining the existing model with the latest data.

**o 模型重建 (Rebuilding):** Redesign and rebuild the model when fundamental business changes occur or the existing structure cannot adapt to new patterns.

**· 完成日期：** 2025年 8 月 31 **Completion Date:** August 31, 2025

**(Continuation for Milestones 4-8 and Other Sections - Translation follows the same pattern)**

第二优先级：门店SKU级销售预测优化

Second Priority: Store SKU-Level Sales Forecasting Optimization

**· 预测目标：** **Forecasting Objective:**

**o 准确预测：** 开发并训练一个新的人工智能模型，旨在提供未来14天内，每日SKC和SKU级别的销售数量的预测。 **Accurate Forecast:** Develop and train a new AI model designed to provide daily sales quantity forecasts at the SKC and SKU level for the next 14 days.

**o 准确性目标：** **Accuracy Target:**

1. 模型应高精度正确识别销售单位（SPU），绝对准确率超过80%的SKU应占所有SKU的80%以上（按销售量计）； The model should accurately identify selling units (SPUs) with high precision. SKUs with an absolute accuracy exceeding 80% should account for more than 80% of all SKUs (weighted by sales volume).

2. 较现有系统，在罚分系统上实现10%的改进。 Achieve a 10% improvement over the existing system based on a penalty system.

**· 惩罚详情：** **Penalty Details:**

o 如果当天结束时商品库存量与当前目标库存请求的数量相符，则无罚分。 No penalty if the end-of-day inventory matches the current target inventory request quantity.

o 如果多了一件商品，那么罚分会比少一件商品少，因为一天结束时少一件商品可能会导致明天错过销售。 If there is one extra item, the penalty is less than if there is one item short, because being short one item at the end of the day might lead to a missed sale tomorrow.

o 此外，如果目标库存数量很大，那么在一天结束时额外一件商品的惩罚应该比目标库存数量较小或为零的情况要低。 Furthermore, if the target inventory quantity is large, the penalty for an extra item at the end of the day should be lower than if the target inventory quantity is small or zero.

o 需要就确切的惩罚值达成一致，并且可以根据惩罚数来评估当前系统。 The exact penalty values need to be agreed upon, and the current system can be evaluated based on the penalty score.

**· 精度（预测精度）：** **Precision (Forecast Accuracy):**

**o 预测有销售商品数量的占比：** 该模型应以高精度正确识别销售单位 (SPU)。每个门店平均预测有销售商品数量占陈列商品数量的比例超过80%. **Proportion of Items Forecasted to Sell:** The model should identify selling units (SPUs) with high precision. The average proportion of displayed items forecasted to have sales per store should exceed 80%.

**o 预测准确率：** 绝对准确率超过80%的SKU应占总SKU的80%以上。 **Forecast Accuracy:** SKUs with an absolute accuracy exceeding 80% should account for more than 80% of total SKUs.

**o 前台/后台准确率：** 将店内实际销售款式按销量降序排序，选取销量最高的TOP 10~30%的款式进行前后端精准测试。 **Front/Back Accuracy:** Sort actual in-store sold styles by sales volume in descending order, select the top 10-30% best-selling styles for front-end and back-end precision testing.

**· 特殊情况处理：** **Handling Special Cases:**

o 当销售记录为零（没有售出商品）时，计算将除以一，而不是将预测和销售记录之间的差除以零。 When sales record is zero (no items sold), the calculation will divide by one, instead of dividing the difference between forecast and sales record by zero.

o 如果销售记录为零且预测为 1，或者如果预测为 1 并且销售记录为零，则应将误差视为较小的百分比，例如 10%，而不是 100%。这是因为错误实际上只是一件商品，而且有很多 SKU 的销售量为零或一次。 If the sales record is zero and the forecast is 1, or if the forecast is 1 and the sales record is zero, the error should be considered a smaller percentage, e.g., 10%, instead of 100%. This is because the error is effectively only one item, and many SKUs have zero or single-unit sales.

**· 任务：** **Tasks:**

o 基于收集的数据的特征工程。 Feature engineering based on collected data.

o 使用历史数据训练人工智能模型。 Train the AI model using historical data.

o 使用测试数据验证模型。 Validate the model using test data.

This is complex as we will change the model architecture to fit the new tracking system.
