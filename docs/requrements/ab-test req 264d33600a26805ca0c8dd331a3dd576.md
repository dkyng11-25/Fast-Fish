**1. Core Logic – KPI Alignment**

*Goal* → The optimisation engine must explicitly maximise **active-sales-rate** (sell-through).

*What you must show* → Objective function or pseudo-code proving the KPI is embedded, plus a short simulation that compares results before vs. after the new objective.

---

**2. Store Clustering – Dimension Completeness**

*Goal* → Clustering cannot ignore merchandising realities. **Store style** and **rack capacity/display class** must be input features.

*What you must show* →

• Updated feature list with style & capacity highlighted.

• Before/after clustering comparison and feature-importance chart.

---

**3. Store Clustering – Business Interpretability**

*Goal* → Stakeholders need to trust the groupings.

*What you must show* →

• A plain-language **store-group profile deck** describing each cluster.

• Silhouette score ≥ 0.5 for the core groups.

• Each cluster labelled with an operational tag (e.g., “Warm-North, Fashion-Heavy”).

---

**4. Product Analysis – Supply-Demand Gap**

*Goal* → Ensure the product pool can actually serve each store group.

*What you must show* → A **gap-analysis report** for at least three representative clusters, covering category, display location, season, gender, price band, style, etc.

---

**5. Allocation Logic – True Optimisation**

*Goal* → Recommendations must come from a constraint-aware optimiser, **not** hand-tuned rules.

*What you must show* →

• Technical note describing the optimisation model (e.g., MILP, heuristic search).

• Live “what-if” demo proving the system adapts when constraints change (store capacity halved, product near end-of-life, etc.).

---

**6. System Output – Usable Format & Content**

*Goal* → Downstream teams need plug-and-play files.

*What you must show* → Sample CSV/Excel that contains:

• **Recommendation timing** (year / month / half-month)

• **Target store-group ID**

• **Product tag combination**

• **Recommended SPU quantity** (integer, allocated to individual stores)

• Meta-info: clustering time, store-group ID, explicit storeabout:blank#blocked list

---

**Verification Artefacts to Deliver**

- Logic / algorithm documentation & key code snippets
- Feature-importance and clustering comparison visuals
- Store-group profile deck (PPT/PDF) + cluster metrics
- Gap-analysis workbook
- Live optimisation demo (screen-share or recorded)
- Example output file + format spec
