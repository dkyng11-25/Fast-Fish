Pipeline Validation Schemas

This module contains validation schemas for pipeline steps 6-14 outputs.
This includes cluster analysis, rule generation, and optimization outputs.

NOTE: This file has been refactored into modular schemas. The schemas are now imported
from the pipeline package for backward compatibility.
